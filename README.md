# Wheelfun Bike Rentals mechanic log database setup

Dataset from 2019-2020 mechanic log over 4 park locations with over 200 products for rental. I worked for this company for two years and was the Assistant Area Manager and Head Mechanic. The data structure for data capture through a QR code link form to an API to Notion's database including the parts order form for me to use. I have concent from the COO of Wheelfun to use this dataset for my portfolio. 

I did not use too complicated dashboards when in actual use just a relational property to a ordering database by part including part numbers for easy descriptions to the parts manager at corpoarte. As well as used a dashboard (kanban board) for the coproate mechanic for our weekly calls for planning bikes as well as planning projects. 

Data Exploration Questions 
How can Wheelfun use data for a well oiled machine for keeping their product in use as much as possible. Using a dashboard and an analysis in the problem of how many mechanics is enough. 


I finsihed the Google Data Analytics course and wanted to make a visualzition or a better version of what I was using before and used Tableu as well as my website to walk through the project.
